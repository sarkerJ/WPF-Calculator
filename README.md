# WPF-Calculator
This is my first project where I used WPF to create an application

---

The application is a simple calculator solution which allows a user to do some basic operations, including:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Power of 2/ Power of n
* Modulus

##### Calculator View

## How to use it

- Enter the **first number** using the buttons provided
  - This can be either a one digit or higher
- You then chose an **operator**
- Enter the **second number**
- Finally click the **equals** symbol to see the result

---

##### Exceptions

* One exception to the instructions above is the **Power of 2** button 
  - For this you have to enter the **first number**
  - And finish by choosing the **Power of 2** button
* This will automatically provide you with an answer without having to select the **equals** button
